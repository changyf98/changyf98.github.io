I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of computational Mathematics](https://math.tsinghua.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the professor. [Dinghui Yang](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%A8%E9%A1%B6%E8%BE%89/5347265?fr=aladdin) . <br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in [University of Science and Technology of China](www.ustc.edu.cn/
) in Heifei, China, where I am a member of 2016 in School of Mathematics science. 

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in **A Deep Learning Based Discontinuous Galerkin Method**, but also include convex optimazation, deep learning and partial differential numerical solutions. <br>
Indeed, My main concern is how to use deep learning to accelerate the computational speed of Discontinuous Galerkin method.
