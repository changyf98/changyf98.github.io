## 🔬 Research

**My personal interest is to explore market rules in a quantitative way**.

During my time at Tsinghua University, my research interests focused on **Deep Learning for solving partial differential equations**, with additional work in:
- Convex Optimization
- Deep Learning Applications
- Numerical Solutions for PDEs
- **Quantitative Trading**

My main research goal was to leverage deep learning to accelerate traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations.
